directories
-----------
docs/
    This directory contains documentation files for OpenHatch and is
    rendered at RTD.

    [FUTURE: It may be possible to remove this directory in a later
    release.]

htmlcov/
    This directory stores reports created by the coverage testing tool.

mysite/
    This directory contains the OpenHatch website and all the "Django
    apps" that are part of it. Each subdirectory is an app.

    Each of the apps has some tests, views, and frequently models and forms.
    Their file paths are:

        */tests.py
        */views.py
        */forms.py
        */models.py

    You can read more about tests, views, forms, and models in the
    official Django tutorial:

        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/

    customs/
        This directory contains "import/export" code like the support for
        loading and saving snapshots of the OpenHatch database, downloading
        data from bug trackers, and scanning other websites for information
        about OpenHatch members.

    profile/
        This app contains code on information about OpenHatch users.

    account/
        This app (mostly) contains code to let a user edit their information.

    missions/
        This is the Django app where the training missions live.

    search/
        This Django app contains the views and models necessary to display
        the volunteer opportunity finder, also known as bug search.

    The apps also use other Django features, or Django add-ons. Here is a
    list by filename and a URL reference to further info:
