There are a whole bunch of files here. Here's what you need to know:

Important files in git
----------------------

README.rst
    Read the README! Read it first.

    It points to our main documentation; this file is just a quick
    thumbnail view of what different files in here are.

    (Aside: it has a ".rst" extension because it is in reStructuredText format.)

COPYING
    This file explains what permissions you have, if you want to re-use
    source code you find in this repository.

vendor/
    This directory contains code from other projects that we rely on.

    (For more information, look at
    http://kitsune.readthedocs.org/en/latest/vendor.html .)

mysite/
    This directory contains the OpenHatch website and all the "Django
    apps" that are part of it. Each subdirectory is an app.

    Each of the apps has some tests, views, and frequently models and forms.
    Their file paths are:

    */tests.py
    */views.py
    */forms.py
    */models.py

	You can read more about tests, views, forms, and models in the
	official Django tutorial:

	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/

    customs/
        This directory contains "import/export" code like the support for
        loading and saving snapshots of the OpenHatch database, downloading
        data from bug trackers, and scanning other websites for information about
        OpenHatch members.

    profile/
        This app contains code to show information about the users of OpenHatch.

    account/
        This app (mostly) contains code to let users edit their own information.

    missions/
        This is the Django app where the training missions live.

    search/
        This Django app contains the views and models necessary to display the volunteer
        opportunity finder, also known as bug search.

    The apps also use other Django features, or Django add-ons. Here is a
    list of filename => further info URLs:

manage.py
    This is the well-known and widely-loved Django management script. (In the past, we used
    to wrap it with ./bin/mysite or ./bin/production. No longer!)

setup.py
    This file lists the dependencies of the OpenHatch codebase.
