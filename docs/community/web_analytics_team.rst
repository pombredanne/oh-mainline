==================
Web Analytics Team
==================

This is the set of people who have access to look at aggregate logs of
our page views. Because we give people access to aggregated
information, we expect it not to be personally identifiable
information, so the privacy implications should not be huge.


Purpose
=======

When design or code or documentation or publicity or other
contributors are thinking about what changes to make to the website,
it is often very helpful to be informed by data about how people are
using the site.


Who may join, and how to join
=============================

Any reasonably trustworthy contributor (such as: people who have shown
up to the #openhatch IRC channel and seem to get along fine with other
members; people who have contributed code to the project; or so forth)
is welcome to join.

We might take your access away if you seem to not have been using it
for one month. That is just constant housekeeping, not because we have
stopped trusting you. If we do that, we will try to notify you (but
might forget to), and you are free to ask for it back.

To join:

Email devel at lists.openhatch.org with a brief message, such as:

I'd like to join the Web Analytics Team because I want to know more about
__________ and think that our aggregate page logs will help with that.

You should expect someone to reply to you within about 4 days with a
yes or a no.


Technology
==========

Right now, we use Google Analytics. You can log in here:

* https://www.google.com/analytics/

People on the Login Team are permitted to have "Manage"-level access.

People on the Web Analytics team are permitted to have "Edit"-level
acces or "View"-level access.

The team isn't technology-specific. If we add another web analytics
tool, we should give these people a similar level of access.
