How and when to submit a new quote
----------------------------------

Let's say something interesting happens on IRC. For example, if your
friend stops by the IRC channel and says something amusing::

    <friend> hey, I just realized
    <friend> oh-mainline... the oh starts for OpenHatch...
    <friend> but it's also, like -- oh! mainline!

and you want to put it in the IRC quotes database. Here are the steps
you take:

* Copy the text to your clipboard on your computer.

* Visit the quotes database at http://boiling-refuge-7775.herokuapp.com/.

* Click *submit quote*

* Enter your quote in the DB, and click *Submit*

* See the glorious "Your quote has been submitted and is now pending
  approval!" message

* Send a private message to paulproteus to ask them to approve it.
