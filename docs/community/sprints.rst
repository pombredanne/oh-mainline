How to run an OpenHatch sprint
==============================

This is a brief set of steps for anyone interested in getting people
together to improve the OpenHatch codebase or web app project. It is
based on `The In-Person Event Handbook`_. We call these "sprints",
after the terminology at pythonsprints.com.

Step 1: Figure out what you want to accomplish at the sprint
------------------------------------------------------------

Some ideas for this can be found in the "What do you want to
accomplish at this event?" section of `The In-Person Event Handbook`_.

Step 2: Pick a date & venue
---------------------------

The date and venue go hand-in-hand, as you might have to reserve
space. See the `Bay Area Debian Shotgun Rules`_ for good things to
think about. Power and wifi and laptop-friendliness are especially
important.

Step 3: Find funding (optional)
-------------------------------

As of the time of writing (December 2013), the Python Software
Foundation is happy to sponsor food. Visit the `Python Sprints Call
for Applications`_ for information on how to apply. It's nice to be
able to say that food is sponsored, so people are more likely to
attend.

In Asheesh's opinion, if food sponsorship is asked-for but not yet
confirmed, it's fine to say in the announcement email that it's
pending confirmation.

Step 4: Figure out the maximum number of people we can support
--------------------------------------------------------------

Given the goals you set, perhaps we only have mentorship resources
available for 4 newcomers or so. In that case, it's best to ask people
to RSVP to you, perhaps by creating an event page on eventbrite.com or
by asking people to send a personal email to the event organizer.

Step 5: Get the word out
------------------------

You should definitely send an email to the `OH-Dev mailing list`_. It's
also a good idea to send (even if brief) personal emails to OpenHatch
contributors in your city.

Write your announcement in the style recommended by the `Bay Area Debian
Shotgun Rules`_.

Consider also Tweeting about it, or getting the pythonsprints.com blog
to send your announcement, or sending an announcement to the Python
Meetup in your city. (It is OK not to do that if you suspect it would
result in more RSVPs than the event can support.)

Step 6: Read the In-Person Event Handbook and follow its instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now is a great time to read the rest of `The In-Person Event
Handbook`_ and think about follow-up processes, validating
documentation, and the preferred modes of communication for attendees
physically at the sprint.

Food sponsorship logistics notes
--------------------------------

Typically, the Python Software Foundation (or any food sponsor) wants
to see an itemized receipt with the food and drink items on it. If the
sprint is at a venue where people typically order one item at a time,
you can simplify life by leaving a tab open and having just one person
pay the bill. Then that person can be the one to get reimbursed.

If a person with an OpenHatch Foundation card is around (such as
Asheesh or Shauna), a good idea is to have that card be the one that
pays the tab. Then the owner of that card is the only one who has to
deal with the reimbursement logistics.
