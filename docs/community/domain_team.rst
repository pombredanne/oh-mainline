===========
Domain Team
===========

The **Domain Team** is the people who can modify settings of the
openhatch.org domain, such as what IP address it points to. The team
also has the same power for all openhatch-owned domains.

Since the team has somewhat limited membership, one goal should is to
be responsive to requests from non-members who want to add or edit our
DNS settings.


Membership
==========

It is difficult to delegate access very widely for this, as anyone
with control over the openhatch.org DNS can probably gain any other
privilege they want. Membership is open to Login Team members or Board
members who merit a special degree of trust.

Current members:

* Asheesh Laroia (paulproteus)
* Shauna Gordon-McKeon (shauna)


How to join
===========

Email asheesh at asheesh.org with at least one sentence to answer why
you need domain/DNS-level access for a thing you're working within
OpenHatch.

You should expect a response within 4 days. If you don't get one, feel
free to send another email that is CC: devel@lists.openhatch.org.


What you get, when you're on the team
=====================================

* CloudFlare DNS password. (Username is asheesh@openhatch.org for now.)


Information useful to members
=============================

* openhatch.org DNS is hosted by cloudflare.com.

* The openhatch.org domain is configured in gandi.net. Currently that
  still uses Asheesh's personal account, but we should change that.

* CloudFlare sends emails to asheesh at openhatch.org. We should
  change that.
