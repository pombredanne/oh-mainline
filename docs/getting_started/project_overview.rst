====================================
Project Overview
====================================

OpenHatch is an effort to help people get involved in free, open source software communities. 

Our main website, `openhatch.org <http://openhatch.org>`_, contains tools to find open source projects you can join, interactive lessons ("missions") to learn the skills needed to get involved, and a place to say what projects you work on or want to help.

We keep the code that runs the website on Github in the repository `oh-mainline <https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline>`_.  The documentation
can be found at `readthedocs.org <http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/>`_.

The website is a Python+Django app with jQuery and CSS and HTML on the frontend, and aims for high test coverage (mostly succeeding) and high usability (though it is not there yet).  You can read more details about how the code is structured in `this document <https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/blob/master/LAYOUT>`_, which we're working to improve.

The best way to contact us about the website is to send an email to `our contributors list <http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/devel>`_ or find us at #openhatch on irc.freenode.net.  (`Other ways to contact us <http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/contact.html>`_.)

Other elements of the OpenHatch project:

* The website is also powered by the "OpenHatch bugimporters," a separate Python-based codebase to download bugs from open source projects' bug trackers, based on Scrapy.

  * code: https://github.com/openhatch/oh-bugimporters
  * docs: http://oh-bugimporters.readthedocs.org/
  * main contact: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/devel or #openhatch on irc.freenode.net

* The OpenHatch blog, a WordPress-based site where the community writes about great things going on in outreach and diversity

  * view it: http://openhatch.org/blog/
  * read about its theming: http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/internals/wordpress.html
  * main contact: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/publicity

* The OpenHatch wiki, where we store notes about events, future and past tech plans, and other general useful bits of text.

  * view it: https://openhatch.org/wiki/
  * read about its theming: FIXME, undocumented mostly
  * main contact: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/publicity or #openhatch on irc.freenode.net

* Open Source Comes to Campus, a series of in-person outreach workshops, especially with Women in CS groups, to help university and college students get involved in free software

  * info: http://campus.openhatch.org/
  * main contact: hello@openhatch.org
  * planning list: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/osctc-planning

* Outreach events such as the Boston Python Workshop for women and their friends that are "affiliated" with us.

  * General info: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Events/Affiliated
  * main contact: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events

* We host email lists for other groups working on efforts also aligned with our goals of diversity and outreach.

  * Big list of email lists: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo
  * Sample lists you'll find here: Women in Free Software India; Organizers of Columbia University Open Source Comes to Campus; etc.

* General thinking about how free software can be improved:

  * For everyone: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/peers
  * Specific planning for the OpenHatch Board: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/board and for 2014 fundraising http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/fundraising-2014

Projects that are sort of being "incubated" by OpenHatch, in that they're not fully ready yet, but are promising and exciting:

Oppia-based rewrite of the training missions:
 * more about Oppia: https://code.google.com/p/oppia/
 * code: https://github.com/openhatch/oh-missions-oppia-beta
 * main contact: Tarashish (sunu) on http://lists.openhatch.org/devel or #openhatch on irc.freenode.net

"Greenhouse," a project to help open source projects greet new contributors:
  * code: https://github.com/openhatch/oh-greenhouse
  * main contact: Dave (daveeloo) on http://lists.openhatch.org/devel or #openhatc on irc.freenode.net
  * Other lists used by the project: http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/greenhouse and http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/welcome-team
