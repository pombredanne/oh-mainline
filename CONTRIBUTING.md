Contributing to OpenHatch
=========================

Before opening a pull request or submitting a patch, please [read the guidelines for contributing](http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor/index.html).

If you submit more than one pull request, you'll find that it's helpful to use a topic branch to avoid duplicating commits.
