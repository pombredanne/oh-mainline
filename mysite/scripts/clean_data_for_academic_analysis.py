# The purpose of this script is to create a version of the database
# that helps a U Mass Amherst researcher look through the OpenHatch
# data and perform text classification and other text analysis.

# To protect our users' privacy, we:
# * set the password column to the empty string
# * set the email column to the empty string
# * delete (from the database) any PortfolioEntry that is_deleted
# * delete (from the database) any Citation that is_deleted
# * delete all WebResponse objects

# set the email and password columns to the empty string
for user in django.contrib.auth.models.User.objects.all():
    user.email = ''
    user.password = ''
    user.save()

# delete PortfolioEntry instances that is_deleted
for pfe in mysite.profile.models.PortfolioEntry.objects.all():
    if pfe.is_deleted:
        pfe.delete()

# delete Citation instances that is_deleted
for citation in mysite.profile.models.Citation.objects.all():
