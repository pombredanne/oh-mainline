      <h3>Tools for working with git</h3>
      <p>If you already have git installed, you may type "git" in the terminal to bring up a list of commonly used git commands, or type "man git" for the full manual. If you don't have git installed yet, please check out this <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">tutorial</a> on how to set it up on your system.</p>
      <p>This page is just a quick reference of the git tools that we have learned; see the bottom for other resources.</p>
      <h3>Configuring git</h3>
      <p>To configure your name:</p>
      <pre>git config --global user.name 'First Last'</pre>
      <p>To configure your email:</p>
      <pre>git config --global user.email 'name@domain.com'</pre>

      <h3>Cloning a git repository</h3>
      <pre>git clone <em>[url]</em> <em>[folder]</em></pre>
      <p><tt>[folder]</tt> is optional. It's for if you want to clone the respository into a specific folder in the current directory. If the folder name specified does not already exist, it will be created.</p>

      <h3>Creating a patch</h3>
      <p>To check the status of the repository:</p>
      <pre>git status</pre>
      <p>It's highly recommended for you to check the status of the repository before performing any git commands, so you can avoid unnecessary problems such as commit collisions.</p>
      <p>To prepare the modified files for committing:</p>
      <pre>git add [file]</pre>
      <p>Note that you may add more than one file by simply concatenate more [file] at the end, seperated by a space.</p>
      <p>To record the changes as a commit:</p>
      <pre>git commit -m "message"</pre>
      <p>To create a file containing the path:</p>
      <pre>git format-patch origin/master</pre>

      <h3>Rebase and merge</h3>
      <p>To update the local copy of a repository:</p>
      <pre>git fetch</pre>
      <pre>git rebase origin/master</pre>

      <h3>Other resources</h3>
      <p>There are many git tools and options. While the ones we mentioned here are commonly used ones, there are many other useful ones you should know. For further reading:</p>
      <ul class="raquo_bullets">
      <li>The <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">official git documentation</a> is your best if you wish to know more about git.</li>
      <li>Git comes with a user "manual". You can read that by typing <tt>man git</tt> in a terminal, or by <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">visiting this page</a>.</li>
      </ul>
